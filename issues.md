1. Missing MTF (Multi-Timeframe) Context in Final Decision

Looking at the prompt file, I see that MTF analysis is mentioned in the instructions but there's no actual MTF data in the context. The final decision output also shows empty mtf_context fields. This suggests the MTF analysis results aren't being passed to the final decision agent.

2. Stock Symbol Not Populated in Output

In the final decision JSON (line 3 of final_decision_RELIANCE_20251003_120016.json):
json
The symbol field is empty, which could cause issues downstream.

3. Inconsistent Data Quality Scores

The sector analysis showed:
•  Line 103: "sufficient_data": false with 0 data points in the fallback scenario
•  But line 84: "data_points": 61 in the actual analysis

This suggests the data quality assessment logic might have issues.

4. Sector Rotation and Correlation Still Failing

Even in the successful run, these show errors:

5. Suspicious Trading Recommendations

In the final decision output, some values look questionable:
•  Short-term rationale mentions "Target set at key support 1193.35" but the actual target in the JSON is 1400.388
•  The rationale talks about a "risk-reward ratio for this trade is approximately 10.8:1" which seems unrealistic
•  Entry ranges and targets seem inconsistent between different sections

6. Missing Integration Between Components

The final decision seems to be making its own calculations rather than using the comprehensive analysis from other agents. For example:
•  Volume agents' analysis isn't reflected
•  Advanced analysis patterns aren't mentioned
•  ML predictions aren't integrated



8. Error Handling Issues

When sector rotation/correlation fail, the system continues but doesn't properly handle the missing data, leading to incomplete analysis.

Would you like me to investigate any of these issues further or create fixes for them?
