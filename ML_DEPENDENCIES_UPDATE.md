# ML Dependencies Update

## Issue Addressed
The ML system was failing in production with the following warnings:
```
CatBoost not available. Pattern ML will not work.
PyTorch not available. LSTM models will not work.
Pattern ML training: FAILED
```

## Root Cause
The required ML libraries were commented out or missing in the `requirements.txt` file:
1. CatBoost was commented out: `# catboost==1.2.5`
2. PyTorch was not included at all

## Changes Made
1. Uncommented CatBoost in `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   # Tabular ML
   catboost==1.2.5
   ```

2. Added PyTorch to `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   # Deep Learning
   torch==2.2.1
   ```

## Expected Results
After deploying these changes:
1. The CatBoost warning should no longer appear
2. The PyTorch warning should no longer appear
3. Pattern ML training should work properly
4. LSTM models should be available

## Deployment Instructions
1. Update the requirements.txt file with the changes above
2. Redeploy the application on Render
3. Monitor logs to confirm the warnings are gone
4. Verify ML functionality is working correctly

## Notes
- If you encounter memory issues on Render, consider upgrading to a higher tier plan
- For large ML models, consider using a separate ML service or worker process
- The ML models will be trained on first use, which might cause initial slowness
