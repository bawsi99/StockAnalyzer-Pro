COMPLETE LLM RESPONSE:
----------------------------------------
I will analyze the provided numerical data and the image to identify institutional buying/selling behavior and smart money flow for BHARTIARTL, and then output the findings in the specified JSON format.

**Data Reconciliation and Interpretation:**

1.  **Activity Level:** The numerical data explicitly states "Activity Level: very_low" under "ADVANCED INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS." While the "Current Volume Ratio: 2.53x" and "Max Volume Ratio: 10.34x" suggest instances of high activity, I will adhere to the explicit "very_low" for the overall institutional activity level as provided.
2.  **Primary Activity:** Explicitly stated as "Primary Activity: distribution" in the "ADVANCED INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS" section, and supported by "Distribution Score: 2.0" and "Selling Pressure Ratio: 54.2%".
3.  **Accumulation vs. Distribution Conflict:** The "OBV Trend: bullish" and "A/D Line Trend: accumulation" conflict with "Primary Activity: distribution" and "Selling Pressure Ratio: 54.2%". Given the task to identify *primary* patterns and the explicit "Primary Activity: distribution" and "Distribution Score: 2.0", I will prioritize distribution as the dominant current institutional behavior. "Quiet Accumulation Score: 0.0" further supports the lack of current quiet accumulation.
4.  **Image Data Gaps:** The image explicitly states "No volume profile data," "No A/D line data," and "No institutional timing data." This limits the analysis for those specific sections, and I will represent them accordingly in the JSON. The "Large Block Detection" chart visually shows spikes, but the "INSTITUTIONAL ACTIVITY SUMMARY" in the image states "Large Blocks Detected: 0" and "Institutional Blocks: 0". I will rely on the numerical "Large Volume Days: 2 (0.8%)" for actual large volume days.
5.  **Activity Confidence:** "Activity Confidence: N/A" is given. Due to the conflicting signals between some trend indicators (OBV, A/D) and the explicit primary activity/scores (distribution, selling pressure), the overall confidence in the assessment will be moderate to low. I will assign "low" as per the JSON format.

Based on this, here is the JSON output:
