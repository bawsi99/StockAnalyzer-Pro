    "rationale": "The long-term trend for HDFCBANK appears bullish as the current price (inferred around 970 from EMA20) is well above the SMA200. However, short-to-medium term moving averages (SMA20 at 964.88 below SMA50 at 984.77, and EMA20 at 970.05 below EMA50 at 976.14) indicate a weakening short-term trend or potential for consolidation/pullback. Momentum is strong with a bullish MACD (histogram 1.97, trend bullish), but the RSI at 65.44, while reported as 'neutral' in its status, is explicitly flagged as 'overbought' in the critical conflict. This creates a significant divergence: short-term bearish MA cross against strong (potentially overextended) momentum. Given the 'CRITICAL severity' of this conflict and the advised resolution to 'Wait for clearer signals or reduce position size', a neutral bias is recommended. It is prudent to await clear trend confirmation, a healthy correction towards support levels, or a definitive breakout above resistance with strong volume before considering a directional trade. No immediate entry, target, or stop-loss are provided due to the lack of clear and consistent signals."

  "conflicts_resolved": "The critical conflict 'SMA20 below SMA50 while RSI overbought' highlights a divergence between weakening short-term price action (bearish MA cross) and strong but potentially unsustainable momentum (overbought RSI). To resolve this, and following the provided guidance, the trading recommendation has been set to 'neutral'. This approach prioritizes caution by advising to wait for clearer, more consistent signals, thereby mitigating the risk associated with conflicting indicators and avoiding premature entry into a potentially uncertain market phase.",
