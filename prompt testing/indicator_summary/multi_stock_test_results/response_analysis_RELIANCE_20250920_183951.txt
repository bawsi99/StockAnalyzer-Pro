    "rationale": "The stock is currently exhibiting conflicting signals that warrant a neutral stance for new positions. While the long-term trend remains bullish (price is 5% above SMA 200 and MACD is bullish), short-term moving averages (SMA 20 below SMA 50, EMA 20 below EMA 50) indicate a weakening of immediate upward momentum or a potential short-term correction. Furthermore, the RSI is in the significantly overbought zone (76.78), suggesting a high probability of a pullback. As per the detected critical signal conflicts, it is advisable to wait for clearer directional confirmation, such as a healthy pullback to established support levels (e.g., 1361.2) or a consolidation phase, before considering initiating new positions."
  },
  "conflicts_resolved": "The analysis resolves the detected conflicts (mixed moving average alignment, RSI overbought vs. MACD bullish) by adopting a neutral trading bias. Despite the underlying long-term bullish trend and current bullish MACD, the short-term moving average crosses indicate weakening momentum, and the overbought RSI suggests high risk of a pullback. Therefore, the recommendation is to follow the provided resolution: 'Wait for clearer signals or reduce position size,' which translates to no immediate directional trade for new entries, allowing the market to resolve these conflicting signals.",
