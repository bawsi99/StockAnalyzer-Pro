    "rationale": "The long-term trend for TCS is bearish, as indicated by the current price being significantly below the 200-day SMA. However, short-term momentum indicators are bullish, with MACD showing an upward trend (positive histogram) and RSI in a neutral but rising zone (59.38). The inferred current price (~3186.03, derived from price_to_sma_200) is also above the 20-day and 50-day SMAs/EMAs, confirming a recent short-term upward movement. This sets up a potential counter-trend rally. A long position is recommended to capitalize on this short-term bullish momentum, targeting the nearest significant resistance at 3545.0, which aligns closely with the 200-day SMA (3579.81), acting as a strong overhead resistance. A stop-loss placed just below the immediate support level of 3056.05 helps manage risk for this counter-trend setup."
  },
  "conflicts_resolved": "The conflict between the prevailing long-term bearish trend (indicated by price significantly below SMA 200 and overall MA stacking) and the strong short-term bullish momentum (MACD, rising RSI, and current price above short-term EMAs/SMAs) is addressed by recommending a short-term counter-trend long position. The trade aims to capture a tactical rally within the broader downtrend, with the target aligned to a major resistance zone (nearest resistance and 200-day SMA) to account for the underlying bearish bias.",
