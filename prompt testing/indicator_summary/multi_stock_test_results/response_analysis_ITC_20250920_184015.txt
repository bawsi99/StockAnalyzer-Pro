    "rationale": "ITC is currently in a consolidation phase, with its price tightly clustered around various moving averages. While long-term trend indicators (SMA200, SMA20/SMA50 relationship) show a slight bearish tilt, short-term momentum (MACD) is bullish, and volume indicators suggest strong buying interest (volume ratio 1.46). This indicates underlying strength. A tactical long position is recommended upon a confirmed breakout above the immediate resistance at 419.8, aiming for the next resistance level. The stop loss is placed just below the breakout level to manage risk effectively."
  },
  "conflicts_resolved": "The trend indicators (SMAs, price to SMA200) suggest a neutral to slightly bearish outlook due to the price being below key moving averages and the SMA20 being below the SMA50. However, momentum indicators (bullish MACD, neutral RSI) and a positive volume ratio (indicating higher buying volume) point towards a potential bullish move. The conflict is resolved by acknowledging the prevailing consolidation but prioritizing the strengthening momentum and volume for a tactical, short-term bullish trade opportunity on a confirmed breakout above resistance.",
